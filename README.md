# Helmet Detection for Miners 🪖

This repository contains the **training and testing files** for a computer vision project aimed at detecting helmets on miners using YOLO and OpenCV.

## 🧠 About the Project
The goal of this project is to improve safety in mining environments by using AI-based helmet detection. It can be integrated into surveillance systems to ensure compliance with safety protocols.

## 📁 What’s Included in This Repository
- YOLO training configuration files
- Testing scripts and detection notebooks
- Sample demo video 🎥
- Labelled dataset folders (only structure; no full dataset)

⚠️ **Note**: The full dataset is **not uploaded here** due to size limits. Please follow the instructions below to download it.
